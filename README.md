# Shuffleboard
## About the Program
This program is was a school project that I have cleaned up for portfolio
purposes. It was a early attempt to write a GUI interface using the Swing library and
implement game and physics logic.  
The game is simply a version of Shuffleboard, with 2 players. The pucks are thrown
down the board and the score is tallied. As yet, there is nothing stopping illegal play,
since when I was younger, that was the most fun part about a Shuffleboard table (just
pushing pucks around).  

## Installation
This archive comes packaged with the binaries, since they are platform-independent.
In order to run it, you must have a Java VM installed. To recompile the program, 
you must have  a Java compiler installed. Either the offical Oracle/Sun
version, or the GCC variant is recommended.  
I recommend also using [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org) for viewing, editing and
compiling.

## Running the Program
The program is run through a command line interface. The general form is 
```sh
java ShuffleBoardApplication
```
Alternatively, you can run the program from within Eclipse.
